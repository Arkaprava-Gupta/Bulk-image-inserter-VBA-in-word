Bulk image inserter VBA in word


Lets you pick a folder,

Inserts every image from that folder into the document,

For each image creates a 2-row × 1-column table (image in top row, blank caption row below),

Hides table borders,

Keeps a maximum of 2 images per page (it inserts a page break after every two images),

Scales images to fit page width and to not exceed half the usable page height (keeps aspect ratio),

Leaves the bottom row empty with placeholder text "Type caption here" so you can type captions.
